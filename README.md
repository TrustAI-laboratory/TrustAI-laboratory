# TrustAI Pte. Ltd.

## Company Introduction
TrustAI is a provider of artificial intelligence security solutions, offering security measures for AI algorithms, models, and the data behind them. TrustAI uses its pioneering intelligent fuzz testing method to perform security regression testing for large models and AI agents built on these models. It helps enterprises and organizations protect privatized models, AI agents, and internal/external AI applications, safeguarding the worldâ€™s most valuable technologies.

In response to the new demands and challenges brought by the era of artificial intelligence, TrustAI focuses on enhancing the robustness, reliability, privacy, and interpretability of AI itself, providing full-lifecycle risk governance services for AI. During the research and development phase, it offers professional assessments, detection, defense, and enhancement capabilities for AI model-related factors (multi-modal datasets and models). During the application phase, it provides one-stop risk monitoring services for large models. It provides integrated management capabilities for AI data, algorithms, scenarios, and models.

TrustAI was founded by AI professionals and security experts, with partners who are senior technical experts from Alibaba, Baidu, and former co-founders of Starcross. These individuals have firsthand experience with the challenges of detecting and defending against adversarial AI attacks. To prove that such attacks can be prevented, the team has developed a unique, patent-pending productized AI security solution that helps organizations monitor risks and protect critical assets.

## Our Mission
TrustAI is on a mission to ensure the safety and integrity of AI systems and unlock the full potential of generative AI while maintaining control and trust. We believe in bringing security to the forefront of AI development, safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities, and promoting responsible AI innovation.
